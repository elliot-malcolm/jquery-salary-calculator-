## Description

<!-- Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? -->

This simple software functions both to tabulate and record employee data, and to act as a vital check on a company's high-ranging expense patterns.  

It stores employee records in an array for later access and analysis, and evaluates total company expenditure based on a custom ceiling, sending out visual alerts if your current (or projected) expense inputs exceed targets.

(It also comes in pink.)
